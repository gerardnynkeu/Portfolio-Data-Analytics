Key Insights & Findings 

1️⃣ Sales Trends Over Time (Sales per Year & Genre)

    Video game sales saw a significant growth from the late 1990s to the mid-2010s, peaking around 2008–2010.
    Action, Sports, and Shooter games contributed the most to overall sales.
    Sales declined post-2015, likely due to digital distribution overtaking physical game sales,
    which may not be reflected in this dataset.

    Wii Sports leads with 29.02 million units sold, followed by Grand Theft Auto V (23.04M) and Mario Kart Wii (12.88M).
    The dominance of Nintendo and Rockstar Games highlights the influence of flagship franchises.

3️⃣ Top 10 Publishers by Sales

    Nintendo dominates the market with 418.3M sales, followed by Electronic Arts (367.4M) and Activision (213.7M).
    Publishers with strong multi-platform releases and long-running franchises drive the highest sales.

    Action games dominate with 516.5M sales, followed by Sports (371.3M) and Shooter (310.5M) genres.
    Casual-friendly genres like Platformers, Puzzle, and Strategy have lower total sales, showing a more niche market. 




🚀 Conclusion & Business Impact

    The data confirms the importance of franchise-building and platform exclusivity in driving high sales.
    The transition from physical to digital sales post-2015 explains the declining sales trend in the dataset.
    Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft remain key players, indicating that game publishers should align their releases
    with their ecosystems for maximum reach and profitability.
