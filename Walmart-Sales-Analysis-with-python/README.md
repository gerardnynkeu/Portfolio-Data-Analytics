<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Loading--and--Dataset--Preparation-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=black&color=blue" alt="Loading and Dataset Preparation" style="width:100%;">

## Loading and Dataset Preparation

A well-structured data analysis begins with properly loading and preparing the dataset. This step ensures that the data is correctly imported, structured, and ready for further preprocessing.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, the dataset is loaded from Kaggle’s built-in storage. Below are the key steps involved:

    Loading the dataset into a structured format using pandas.
    Displaying basic information to understand the dataset’s structure.
   

Here’s the complete code for this step:

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Data--Preprocessing-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=black&color=blue" alt="Data Preprocessing" style="width:100%;">

## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any data analysis workflow. It involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw data to ensure high-quality inputs for analysis and modeling. This step addresses common data issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, incorrect data types, and outliers.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, preprocessing was performed using Python’s powerful data manipulation libraries. The key steps include:

    Handling missing values (imputation or removal).
    Checking and removing duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
    Converting data types for consistency and efficient processing.
    Handling outliers using statistical methods.

Below is the full code for the data preprocessing step:

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature--Engineering-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=black&color=blue" alt="Feature Engineering" style="width:100%;">

## Feature Engineering 

Feature engineering is a crucial step in the data preparation pipeline, where raw data is transformed into more informative features to improve model performance and analytical insights. This process involves creating new variables, encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, and deriving meaningful attributes.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, feature engineering was performed using Python’s powerful libraries such as pandas and sklearn. The key steps include:

    Creating new features to enhance predictive power.
    Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
    Scaling numerical features to standardize the data.
    Extracting time-based features to capture seasonality and trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis workflow. It involves summarizing, visualizing, and understanding the structure of the dataset before applying advanced modeling techniques. The goal is to detect patterns, identify correlations, and recognize potential outliers that could impact analysis or predictions.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, EDA was performed using Python’s powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The key steps include:

    Understanding dataset structure (shape, columns, data types).
    Visualizing distributions of numerical and categorical variables.
    Detecting correlations and relationships between features.
    Identifying outliers and potential anomalies.

Below is the full code for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) step:

**Distribution Analysis**:

Weekly Sales: Right-skewed with multiple peaks, indicating concentration of lower sales and potential seasonality. Further segmentation may reveal deeper trends.
Temperature: Bimodal, suggesting data from regions with distinct climates, possibly influencing sales seasonality.
Fuel Price: Bimodal, likely due to regional or temporal fluctuations, potentially affecting consumer spending.
CPI: Highly skewed, reflecting economic variability that may impact purchasing power.
Unemployment Rate: Right-skewed, with most values between 6-9%. Higher rates may correlate with reduced sales.

</p> 







**Correlation Analysis**:

Weekly Sales: Very weak correlations with other variables, suggesting non-linear influences like promotions or seasonality. Slight negative correlation with unemployment (-0.11) indicates minimal impact.
Temperature: Moderately correlated with CPI (0.18) and fuel price (0.14), hinting at seasonal effects.
Fuel Price: Negatively correlated with CPI (-0.17), but negligible impact on sales (0.01).
CPI & Unemployment: Moderate negative correlation (-0.30), aligning with economic theory—higher unemployment leads to lower consumer prices.

</p> 





**Interpretation**:

The analysis shows that holidays account for only 6.99% of total sales weeks, indicating that Walmart’s revenue is largely driven by non-holiday periods. There are no significant spikes in holiday sales, suggesting a stable shopping pattern throughout the year. This highlights the importance of year-round promotions rather than relying solely on holiday-driven sales.

</p> 





**Interpretation**:

The bar chart and pie chart illustrate the distribution of data points across the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The data is fairly balanced, with 2011 having the highest count (36.36%), followed by 2010 (33.57%) and 2012 (30.07%). While there is a slight decline in data availability in 2012, the overall distribution remains relatively even, ensuring a well-represented analysis over the three years. This consistency helps maintain the reliability of time-based trends in sales performance.
