## Introduction
Business Problem and Objectives

Walmart, one of the largest retail chains in the world, generates vast amounts of sales data across multiple store locations. Understanding sales patterns and identifying key influencing factors can help optimize business strategies, enhance forecasting accuracy, and drive revenue growth. This project aims to analyze Walmart's weekly sales data to:

Identify trends and patterns in sales performance.

Assess the impact of external factors such as holidays, fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rates on sales.

Provide actionable insights that can help improve business decision-making.

## Loading and Dataset Preparation

A well-structured data analysis begins with properly loading and preparing the dataset. This step ensures that the data is correctly imported, structured, and ready for further preprocessing.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, the dataset is loaded from Kaggle’s built-in storage. Below are the key steps involved:

    Loading the dataset into a structured format using pandas.
    Displaying basic information to understand the dataset’s structure.
   

Here’s the complete code for this step:

<!-- Data Preprocessing Banner -->
<a id="data-preprocessing"></a>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Data--Preprocessing-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=black&color=blue" alt="Data Preprocessing" style="width:100%;">

## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any data analysis workflow. It involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw data to ensure high-quality inputs for analysis and modeling. This step addresses common data issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, incorrect data types, and outliers.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, preprocessing was performed using Python’s powerful data manipulation libraries. The key steps include:

    Handling missing values (imputation or removal).
    Checking and removing duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
    Converting data types for consistency and efficient processing.
    Handling outliers using statistical methods.

Below is the full code for the data preprocessing step:

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature--Engineering-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=black&color=blue" alt="Feature Engineering" style="width:100%;">

## Feature Engineering 

Feature engineering is a crucial step in the data preparation pipeline, where raw data is transformed into more informative features to improve model performance and analytical insights. This process involves creating new variables, encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, and deriving meaningful attributes.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, feature engineering was performed using Python’s powerful libraries such as pandas and sklearn. The key steps include:

    Creating new features to enhance predictive power.
    Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
    Scaling numerical features to standardize the data.
    Extracting time-based features to capture seasonality and trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis workflow. It involves summarizing, visualizing, and understanding the structure of the dataset before applying advanced modeling techniques. The goal is to detect patterns, identify correlations, and recognize potential outliers that could impact analysis or predictions.

Since this project was executed directly on Kaggle's Jupyter Notebook environment, EDA was performed using Python’s powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The key steps include:

    Understanding dataset structure (shape, columns, data types).
    Visualizing distributions of numerical and categorical variables.
    Detecting correlations and relationships between features.
    Identifying outliers and potential anomalies.

Below is the full code for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) step:

**Distribution Analysis**:

Weekly Sales: Right-skewed with multiple peaks, indicating concentration of lower sales and potential seasonality. Further segmentation may reveal deeper trends.
Temperature: Bimodal, suggesting data from regions with distinct climates, possibly influencing sales seasonality.
Fuel Price: Bimodal, likely due to regional or temporal fluctuations, potentially affecting consumer spending.
CPI: Highly skewed, reflecting economic variability that may impact purchasing power.
Unemployment Rate: Right-skewed, with most values between 6-9%. Higher rates may correlate with reduced sales.

</p> 







**Correlation Analysis**:

Weekly Sales: Very weak correlations with other variables, suggesting non-linear influences like promotions or seasonality. Slight negative correlation with unemployment (-0.11) indicates minimal impact.
Temperature: Moderately correlated with CPI (0.18) and fuel price (0.14), hinting at seasonal effects.
Fuel Price: Negatively correlated with CPI (-0.17), but negligible impact on sales (0.01).
CPI & Unemployment: Moderate negative correlation (-0.30), aligning with economic theory—higher unemployment leads to lower consumer prices.

**Seasonal Sales Analysis:** 

**Autumn & Winter**: Highest sales in 2010-2011, driven by holidays (Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas). Peak: Winter 2011 (~$6.29B).

**Spring & Summer**: Lower sales, except for Summer 2012 (~$6.69B), possibly due to promotions or external factors.

**2012 Anomaly**: Unusual Summer peak, Winter drop (~$3.61B). Likely influenced by economic shifts or retail strategy changes.

## Limitations 

Despite the insights gained from this analysis, several limitations should be considered:

Data Completeness & Quality – The dataset hat no missing values. Data cleaning techniques were applied, but incomplete records might introduce biases.

Feature Limitations – The dataset primarily includes transactional and time-series data but lacks detailed customer demographics, marketing campaigns, or external economic factors that influence sales trends.

Holiday Influence Simplification – The dataset flags holidays, but it does not account for varying regional effects, holiday-specific promotions, or seasonal factors beyond binary classification.

External Market Conditions – Economic indicators, competitor pricing, and supply chain factors are not included, which limits a more comprehensive market analysis.

Time Scope Constraints – The dataset spans a limited period, meaning long-term trends, shifts in consumer behavior, and emerging market patterns may not be fully captured.

Granularity of Data – The dataset aggregates sales at a higher level, potentially masking store-specific or product-level insights that could enhance targeted decision-making.

By acknowledging these limitations, the analysis remains transparent, and future research directions can be explored to refine predictive modeling and business recommendations.

## Future Work 

This exploratory analysis provided valuable insights into Walmart's sales trends, but further work can enhance the depth and applicability of findings:

Predictive Modeling – Implement machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast future sales based on historical data and external factors.

Time Series Analysis – Apply time series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to capture seasonality, holiday effects, and long-term sales trends.

Market Basket Analysis – If item-level data becomes available, association rule mining (e.g., Apriori, FP-Growth) can be used to analyze customer purchasing patterns.

Sentiment Analysis & External Data Integration – Incorporate social media sentiment, economic reports, and competitor pricing data to better understand demand fluctuations.

Advanced Feature Engineering – Engineer new variables such as moving averages, holiday proximity impact, and store-type segmentation to improve sales predictions.

Geospatial Analysis – If location data is available, map sales performance across different regions to identify geographic trends and store-level optimizations.

Dashboard Development – Build interactive dashboards using Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash to visualize insights in real-time for stakeholders.

Causal Inference & A/B Testing – Conduct experiments to assess the effectiveness of promotions, pricing strategies, and in-store changes on sales performance.

By expanding the scope of analysis with these methods, deeper business insights can be generated to support data-driven decision-making at Walmart.
