## Introduction
Business Problem and Objectives

Walmart, one of the largest retail chains in the world, generates vast amounts of sales data across multiple store locations. Understanding sales patterns and identifying key influencing factors can help optimize business strategies, enhance forecasting accuracy, and drive revenue growth. This project aims to analyze Walmart's weekly sales data to:

Identify trends and patterns in sales performance.

Assess the impact of external factors such as holidays, fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rates on sales.

Provide actionable insights that can help improve business decision-making.

## Dataset Overview


The dataset contains weekly sales data from multiple Walmart stores across different time periods. It includes the following attributes:

Store: Unique identifier for each store.

Date: The week of sales recorded.

Weekly_Sales: The total revenue generated by the store in a given week.

Holiday_Flag: A binary indicator (1 = holiday week, 0 = non-holiday week).

## Data Source and Justification

This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and provides a real-world scenario for analyzing sales performance using Python. The combination of sales, economic indicators, and seasonal trends makes it a valuable resource for applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

By examining this data, we can uncover insights that may help retailers optimize inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies while understanding the macroeconomic factors affecting sales performance.
