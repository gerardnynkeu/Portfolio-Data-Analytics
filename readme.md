## Introduction

Analyzing the Impact of Influencer Marketing with Simple Linear Regression

In this project, I worked as part of an analytics team tasked with delivering insights about our company's sales and marketing practices. My specific focus was on exploring the use of influencer marketing and analyzing its effectiveness in driving sales.

To achieve this, I employed simple linear regression to model the relationship between the radio promotion budget and sales revenue. This approach allowed me to assess both the direction and magnitude of the relationship between these variables, uncovering patterns that could guide data-driven decisions.

The dataset provided contained detailed information about various marketing campaigns, including investments in TV, radio, and social media promotions, as well as the corresponding revenue generated. By analyzing this data, I aimed to provide company leaders with actionable insights to optimize future marketing strategies.

The ultimate goal was to help decision-makers allocate resources more effectively by identifying which marketing channels deliver the highest return on investment. This project demonstrated the power of simple linear regression in transforming large datasets into meaningful insights, enabling better predictions and strategic decision-making.
