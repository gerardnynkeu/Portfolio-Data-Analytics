## 1. Introduction 

In this project, we will perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dirty e-commerce dataset. The dataset simulates real-world business data, containing errors, missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies that are common in raw data collected from various sources.

The goal of this project is to apply data wrangling techniques using R to transform the messy dataset into a structured and analyzable format. This will involve:

Handling missing values and duplicates Correcting invalid or inconsistent data entries Converting data types appropriately Identifying outliers and anomalies Performing exploratory data analysis to extract insights By the end of this project, we will have a clean dataset ready for further business analysis and visualization. 


## 2. Data Overview 

This dataset contains 9,000+ rows and 20+ columns, providing detailed information on customer transactions, including order details, customer demographics, sales data, and shipping information. Below is a description of each feature:
