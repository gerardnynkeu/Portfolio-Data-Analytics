## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive SQL-driven exploratory analysis of Airbnb listings in York City, based on a public dataset available on Kaggle. The goal was to extract meaningful insights regarding host activity, pricing trends, room types, availability, and review behavior, using structured query language (SQL) exclusively.

## Objectives

- **Practice and demonstrate real-world SQL data exploration skills**

- **Understand Airbnb market trends in York City**

- **Identify actionable insights for both hosts and guests**

- **Communicate findings in a clear, business-oriented manner**

## Tools & Technologies

- Platform: Kaggle Notebooks

- Language: SQL (BigQuery syntax)

- Data Source: Inside Airbnb Open Data

- Visualization: SQL output tables + built-in Kaggle chart tools

## Key Analysis Areas


- **Listing Overview by Area**  
  - Counted listings per neighborhood group to identify the most saturated areas.  
  - Revealed the city center as the most active location.  

- **Price Insights by Room Type**  
  - Compared average prices across Entire Homes, Private Rooms, and Shared Rooms.  
  - Entire Homes showed significantly higher pricing, especially in central areas.  

- **Review Trends**  
  - Analyzed monthly review frequency to detect demand seasonality.  
  - Noticed peaks in review activity during the spring and summer months.  

- **Availability vs. Price**  
  - Explored how availability (365 days) correlates with pricing.  
  - Discovered a subset of affordable, highly available listings — potential sweet spots for budget-conscious travelers.  

- **Top Hosts**  
  - Ranked hosts by the number of listings.  
  - Identified a few dominant hosts with multiple properties, suggesting semi-professional operations.  

## Key Findings

- City Center holds the majority of listings and commands the highest average prices.
- Private rooms offer a budget-friendly alternative, often under £100/night.
- Top hosts own a significant portion of listings, showing a skewed distribution.
- Seasonality plays a role in review activity, with peaks during warmer months.
- High availability does not always correlate with higher pricing, suggesting untapped opportunities.

## What I Learned

- Improved my proficiency in writing efficient SQL queries to explore, group, and filter large datasets
- Gained a deeper understanding of Airbnb's business model and dynamics
- Strengthened my ability to tell a data story using only SQL and Markdown
- Practiced translating technical findings into actionable business insights

## Next Steps

- Expand the analysis with Python for visualization (e.g., Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Conduct predictive modeling for pricing or demand forecasting
- Compare with other cities to contextualize York’s market
