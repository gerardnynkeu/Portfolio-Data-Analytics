# 📊 District-wise Education Statistics Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing district-wise educational infrastructure and literacy rates across various Indian states. Using descriptive statistics, the notebook explores disparities in education, infrastructure distribution, and correlations between population and literacy. This work aims to provide insights useful for educational planning, policy-making, and equitable resource allocation.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **680 entries** and includes the following key features:

- **DISTNAME**: District name  
- **STATNAME**: State name  
- **BLOCKS**: Number of administrative blocks  
- **VILLAGES**: Number of villages in the district  
- **CLUSTERS**: School clusters (likely administrative school units)  
- **TOTPOPULAT**: Total population (634 non-null values)  
- **OVERALL_LI**: Overall literacy rate (%) (634 non-null values)

### 🧩 Key Observations

- Some missing values exist in population and literacy rate columns.
- The dataset provides both infrastructural and outcome-based education indicators.
- It enables regional comparisons and deeper statistical insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Descriptive Statistics** for data summary and interpretation

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Exploration**: Identification of missing values, unique state/district counts, and data types.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and distribution (skewness, kurtosis).
- **Visual Analysis**: Histograms, bar plots, and box plots to understand data distribution and outliers.
- **Insights**:
  - Variations in educational infrastructure across states.
  - Relationship between total population and literacy rate.
  - Identification of potential outlier districts with very high or low literacy rates.

## 📌 Conclusion

The analysis revealed significant disparities in educational infrastructure and literacy across districts. By applying statistical methods, we identified patterns that could inform better resource planning and educational interventions in underserved areas.
