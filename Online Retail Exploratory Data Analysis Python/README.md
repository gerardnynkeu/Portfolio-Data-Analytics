## <span style="color:#2E86C1"><b>Overview</b></span> 

In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to help make a key business decision.

---

## <span style="color:#28B463"><b>Case Study</b></span> 

In this project, you will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## <span style="color:#D35400"><b>Prerequisites</b></span> 

Before starting this project, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and Pandas. In addition, you may want to use the following packages in your Python environment:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

These packages should already be installed in Coursera's Jupyter Notebook environment, however if you'd like to install additional packages that are not included in this environment or are working off platform you can install additional packages using `!pip install packagename` within a notebook cell such as:

- `!pip install pandas`
- `!pip install matplotlib`

## <span style="color:#8E44AD"><b>Project Objectives</b></span> 

1. Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

---

## <span style="color:#2E4053"><b>Dataset</b></span>

The dataset you will be working with is the "Online Retail" dataset. It contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011. The dataset is available as a .xlsx file named `Online Retail.xlsx`. 

The dataset contains the following columns:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number of the transaction
- StockCode: Unique code of the product
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: Quantity of the product in the transaction
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
- UnitPrice: Unit price of the product
- CustomerID: Unique identifier of the customer
- Country: Country where the transaction occurred

---

## <span style="color:#A93226"><b>Tasks</b></span> 

You may explore this dataset in any way you would like - however if you'd like some help getting started, here are a few ideas:

1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.
2. Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any redundant or unnecessary columns.
3. Explore the basic statistics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
4. Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.
5. Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
6. Explore the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold.
7. Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.
8. Draw conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.

### <span style="color:#A93226"><b>Load the Data</b></span> 

The dataset was loaded using pandas from an Excel file named Online Retail.xlsx. Below is the initial setup:

This step initializes the environment and provides a quick look at the structure of the dataset before beginning the data exploration and analysis process.

### <span style="color:#A93226"><b>Data Cleaning</b></span> 

Before diving into analysis, it was essential to clean the dataset by addressing missing values and removing redundant or irrelevant columns. This step ensures the quality and reliability of insights derived from the data. Proper data cleaning helps improve performance in both exploratory analysis and any potential machine learning applications.

![Missing Value Analysis](https://github.com/gerardnynkeu/Portfolio-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Online%20Retail%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20Python/missing%20value.png) 

There are 1,454 missing values in the Description column.

There are 135,080 missing values in the CustomerID column â€” that's a lot! 



To prepare the dataset for analysis, I first checked for missing values. I discovered that the CustomerID column had over 135,000 missing entries, and the Description column had 1,454 missing values. Since these columns are essential for customer segmentation and product-level insights, I removed rows where either CustomerID or Description was missing. I also removed duplicate rows to avoid skewing the analysis.

## <span style="color:#1F618D"><b>Basic Statistics</b></span> 

To understand the overall structure and distribution of the data, I performed an initial statistical exploration. This included calculating key measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, min, max, quartiles). These insights provide a solid foundation for identifying patterns, outliers, and potential data quality issues before deeper analysis.

ðŸ“Š Summary Statistics

The dataset contains 401,604 transactions, with noticeable variation in both quantity and unit price:

    Quantity:

        Median: 5 items

        Most common: 1 item

        Mean: 12.18 (with high variability due to outliers like returns or bulk orders)

    Unit Price:

        Median: Â£1.95

        Most common: Â£1.25

        Mean: Â£3.47 (skewed by a few high-priced items)

    Most transactions involve small quantities of low-cost items, though some outliers suggest bulk purchases or data anomalies.

## <span style="color:#16A085"><b>Data Visualization</b></span> 

To gain deeper insights into the dataset, I performed exploratory data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Visualizations help uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that may not be obvious through raw statistics alone.

The following aspects were explored:

    Distribution of Unit Price â€“ Understand pricing behavior across products.

    Top 10 Countries by Total Sales â€“ Identify key markets contributing to revenue.

    Top 10 Products by Revenue â€“ Highlight the most profitable items.

    Monthly Sales Trend â€“ Analyze seasonality and performance over time.

These visualizations provide a strong foundation for understanding customer behavior and business performance.

ðŸ“Š Distribution of Unit Prices (Filtered) â€“ Interpretation

This histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) shows the distribution of unit prices in the dataset after filtering out extreme outliers. The data is highly right-skewed, indicating that most unit prices are concentrated at the lower end (between 0 and 5), with very few items priced above 20. This suggests that the majority of products are low-cost, and only a small proportion are premium-priced items. This insight can help businesses adjust pricing strategies or identify potential pricing anomalies.
