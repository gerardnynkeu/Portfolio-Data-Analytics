Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of performing Linear Regression using Python. The dataset is analyzed to uncover key relationships and build a predictive model. The workflow includes data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

Step 1: Imports and Data Loading

1.1 Import Libraries

Before working with the dataset, we import necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels.

1.2 Load Dataset

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and reviewed for initial exploration.

Step 2: Data Exploration

2.1 Display First 10 Rows

A preview of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2.2 Dataset Dimensions

Checking the number of rows and columns to assess the dataset size.

2.3 Check Missing Values

Identifying any missing data to ensure data completeness.

2.4 Handle Missing Values

Applying appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation or removal) to handle missing values.

2.5 Pairwise Relationships

Using visualization techniques such as pairplots to explore relationships between features.

Step 3: Model Building

3.1 Select Relevant Columns

Choosing the independent and dependent variables for the regression model.

3.2 Linear Regression Formula

Defining the regression equation to be fitted to the data.

3.3 Fit the Model

Training the linear regression model using statsmodels.

Step 4: Results and Evaluation

4.1 Model Summary

Generating a summary of the fitted model to interpret results.

4.2 Key Coefficients

Extracting and analyzing the key coefficients of the regression model.

4.3 Regression Plot

Visualizing the regression line and the relationship between variables.

4.4 Residual Distribution

Analyzing the distribution of residuals to check for normality.

4.5 Q-Q Plot for Normality

Using a Q-Q plot to further assess the normality of residuals.

4.6 Scatterplot of Residuals

Plotting residuals against predicted values to check for patterns or heteroscedasticity.

Conclusion

5.1 Key Takeaways

Summarizing the key findings and implications of the analysis.

5.2 Framing Findings for Stakeholders

Interpreting the results in a way that is actionable for decision-makers and stakeholders.
