Introduction

üìå Introduction

Understanding the impact of marketing strategies on sales is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their advertising budget. This dataset provides insights into the relationship between different marketing channels and sales performance. By analyzing these data points, we can identify key trends and build predictive models to enhance decision-making in marketing investments.
üìä Dataset Description

This dataset contains information on sales performance and marketing expenditures across different advertising channels. It includes 572 observations and 5 variables, described as follows:

    TV (categorical: "Low", "Medium", "High"): Level of investment in TV advertising.
    Radio (numeric: float): Amount spent on radio advertising.
    Social Media (numeric: float): Amount spent on social media advertising.
    Influencer (categorical: "Mega", "Macro", "Micro"): Type of influencer used in the campaign.
    Sales (numeric: float): Total sales generated.

üîç Dataset Overview

    Total Entries: 572
    Missing Values:
        TV: 1 missing value
        Radio: 1 missing value
        Sales: 1 missing value
    Descriptive Statistics:
        Radio: Mean ‚âà 18.65, Min ‚âà 0.19, Max ‚âà 48.87
        Social Media: Mean ‚âà 3.25, Min ‚âà 0.01, Max ‚âà 11.26
        Sales: Mean ‚âà 193.52, Min ‚âà 31.20, Max ‚âà 358.42



Step 1: Imports and Data Loading

1.1 Import Libraries

Before working with the dataset, we import necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels.

1.2 Load Dataset

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and reviewed for initial exploration.

Step 2: Data Exploration

2.1 Display First 10 Rows

A preview of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2.2 Dataset Dimensions

Checking the number of rows and columns to assess the dataset size.

2.3 Check Missing Values

Identifying any missing data to ensure data completeness.

2.4 Handle Missing Values

Applying appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation or removal) to handle missing values.

2.5 Pairwise Relationships

Using visualization techniques such as pairplots to explore relationships between features.

Step 3: Model Building

3.1 Select Relevant Columns

Choosing the independent and dependent variables for the regression model.

3.2 Linear Regression Formula

Defining the regression equation to be fitted to the data.

3.3 Fit the Model

Training the linear regression model using statsmodels.

Step 4: Results and Evaluation

4.1 Model Summary

Generating a summary of the fitted model to interpret results.

4.2 Key Coefficients

Extracting and analyzing the key coefficients of the regression model.

4.3 Regression Plot

Visualizing the regression line and the relationship between variables.

4.4 Residual Distribution

Analyzing the distribution of residuals to check for normality.

4.5 Q-Q Plot for Normality

Using a Q-Q plot to further assess the normality of residuals.

4.6 Scatterplot of Residuals

Plotting residuals against predicted values to check for patterns or heteroscedasticity.

Conclusion

5.1 Key Takeaways

Summarizing the key findings and implications of the analysis.

5.2 Framing Findings for Stakeholders

Interpreting the results in a way that is actionable for decision-makers and stakeholders.
