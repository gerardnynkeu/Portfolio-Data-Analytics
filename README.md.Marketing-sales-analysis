📖 Introduction

This project explores how marketing expenditures across TV, Radio, and Newspapers affect sales performance. The goal is to build a regression model to determine which marketing channel provides the highest return on investment.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Marketing Sales Dataset (Replace with actual link)

Description: The dataset contains information on marketing budgets and sales revenue.

Key Features:

TV: Advertising budget spent on TV

Radio: Advertising budget spent on radio

Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on newspapers

Sales: Total sales revenue

⚙️ Installation & Requirements

To run this project, install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels

or

conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels

🚀 Project Workflow

Step 1: Data Loading & Exploration

Load dataset using pandas

Display summary statistics

Check for missing values and handle them accordingly

Step 2: Data Visualization

Generate pairplots to explore feature relationships

Plot distribution of sales

Step 3: Model Building

Select relevant variables for regression

Build a Linear Regression model using statsmodels

Evaluate model performance using R² and RMSE

Step 4: Results & Evaluation

Analyze key coefficients to understand marketing effectiveness

Generate residual plots to check regression assumptions

Interpret findings for actionable insights

📊 Results & Insights

TV marketing budget has the strongest correlation with sales.

Radio advertising contributes moderately.

Newspaper advertising has minimal impact on sales performance.

The regression model provides data-driven insights to optimize marketing budgets.

📌 Conclusion

🔹 Investing more in TV and Radio advertising is likely to yield higher sales.🔹 Newspaper marketing may not be cost-effective.🔹 Businesses should use data-driven marketing strategies for better ROI.
