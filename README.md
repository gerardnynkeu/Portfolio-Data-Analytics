👨‍💻 About Me

I am Gerard, a passionate Data Analyst based in Germany with a strong background in material and product development engineering. My journey into data analytics was fueled by my curiosity to transform raw data into meaningful insights. I hold both the Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate and the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, equipping me with robust analytical skills to solve complex business challenges.

Beyond analytics, I have an entrepreneurial mindset, having been an E-commerce shop owner, where I managed everything independently— from marketing and advertising (Facebook Ads, SEO, and customer engagement) to logistics and inventory management. My diverse experience helps me understand both technical and business aspects, making me a well-rounded analyst.
